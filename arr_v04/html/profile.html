            <span>About Me</span> I am a continuous learner IT enthusiast with a drive for best quality and creativity in mind. I have
            always been fascinated of how technology has revolutionized the world and our daily lives. As a 90's kid, I
            remember using my first computer messing with CRT monitor and a mouse with ball inside. Nowadays, modern
            technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices that makes our lives easier, better, faster, and more
            fun.

            <span>Tech Life</span> In order to engage myself into tech industry, I took a degree as a Bachelor of Science in
            Computer Engineering from Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Right after school, I really wanted to work
            in the network side of the industry where I handle routers, servers, etc. But things doesn’t happen as much as I
            want to. No matter how I plan my career, if it’s not for me, I won’t get it. To make the story short, I
            ended up in the software side of the industry. Personally, this was a tough pathway, but I find it challenging
            and interesting.

            <span>When you stop learning, you stop growing</span> Since I earned my degree as a Bachelor of Science in Computer 
            Engineering from Polytechnic University of the Philippines, I had been enthusiastically working in the IT industry. 
            To keep myself relevant in the software space and for professional growth, I decided to leave the workforce and go 
            back to school. I enrolled to a Diploma program in Digital Media and IT with concentration in General Software 
            Development from Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) where I gained knowledge and skills on the
            technologies used in frontend and backend software/web development. But learning doesn’t stop on the four
            corners of the classroom. As a firm believer of continuous learning, I always find time learning about latest
            technologies that are available online and trying to improve continually so my skills won’t get obsolete.
