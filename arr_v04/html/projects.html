        <!-- start of STATIC WEB PROJECTS -->
        <p>
            <span>T</span>hese are all static web pages which are as good as a feature of web application/software that are hosted in github pages. These academic projects generally showcase the skills of being a frontend developer where I developed the art of designing as well as the science of client-side programming. The combination of these skills makes the website visually appealing to the user by making sure that the design and functionality of website can interact easily. So take a look on each project to give you a sense of the technologies I work with.

This is basically an introduction to web development where I was able to code HTML forms and learned the foundation in building web projects. Mark-up and images were provided here.

            <span>B</span>elow projects are all dynamic web pages that involve the use of servers and databases. These academic projects generally showcase the skills of being a backend developer where the application of server-side logic and integration is being developed. Additionally, making these projects also developed my skills to manage and maintain databases as well as test and debug back end processes to ensure that a program functions smoothly and effectively at all times. Since these projects involve the use of servers, unfortunately for some projects, I wasn't able to backup any contents in the server. So in order for me to showcase my work, I will instead direct you to my github repository for you to have a feel of the technologies I work with.

        <p>
            <span>I</span>nside the door are multiple projects related to cybersecurity. These projects generally showcase the skills of being a cyber defender where I developed the art of defending and protecting computer systems and networks from cyber threats and attacks. The combination of these skills makes me a well-rounded cybersecurity professional by making sure that I can identify vulnerabilities, implement security measures, and respond effectively to incidents to safeguard digital assets and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. So feel free to open each door to see my enthusiasm and commitment in the world of cybersecurity while I prepare for certifications and career opportunities.
