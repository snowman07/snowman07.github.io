  - `arr_v03` folder is added which is going to be my `latest personal portfolio` because it is in this folder/repository where I will include my skills in cybersecurity.

- 12/28/2025
  - in the folder `arr_v03`, functionality of `SASS` (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) was integrated/added. SASS is a more organize way of styling a website, which is used by front-end developers.
  - When using SASS, it is a must to follow a `BEM standard`. BEM (`Block Element Modifier`) is a standard naming convention to have a consistent and organized approach for styling.

    - [How to Create an HTML & SCSS Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTVmhPrtDOE)
      - this youtube is basically the steps to `install SASS compiler` and `watch the changes in scss file`. Command to watch is: `sass --watch [location of .scss] [location of .css]`. This command will run continuously in your terminal. As you save changes to style.scss, the css/style.css file will be automatically updated with the compiled CSS code.
      - ~~`CAVEAT`: Installing SASS in an existing CSS would `REMOVED` the existing css codes. As a workaround, it is better if you copy the entire file (in this case, arr_v02 folder is copied to make arr_v03). Then I just copied the CSS codes from arr_v02 and pasted the css codes to arr_v03.~~

      - this is the `MOST USEFUL` resources so far in adding SASS/SCSS in an existing CSS files.
