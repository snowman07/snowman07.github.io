## `Updates`
 - 12/23/2025
   - Added `dev` branch. Purpose is to first work in `dev` branch before merging it to the `main` branch. `dev` branch can also be used as the baseline in creating another branch.
 - 12/29/2025
   - Decided not to continue with `arr_v03` as this would take pretty decent time to finish.
     - Branches in this repository:
       - main branch - no significant changes in files, output is similar to previous portfolio (arrpogi, arr_v02).
       - dev branch - no significant changes in files and output.
       - dev02-door branch
         - `organized the html files` where landing page, software skills, and cybersecurity skills were supoosed to be separated.
         - output has `two menus`: `profile` and `skills`. This is the `REVAMP PLAN` where I will separate software skills and cybersecurity skills. Skills menu doesn't configured yet to be redirected to the div
       - dev03-scss branch
         - same file setup with dev02-door branch with added `scss` folder for `SASS` styling approach.
         - skills menu is already configured. Added codes for opening a door animation based in `SASS approach`.
